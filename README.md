# Alarm System
<p align="justify">
A FreeRTOS-based Alarm System created with STM32 Nucleo board using the F446RE Arm Cortex-M4 32-bit RISC core. The goal of this project is to provide home owners with a     reliable security solution. After arming the system using a password, the alarm will be triggered 60 seconds after detecting any movement. The user can then disable this feature by disarming with the same password. The user can then change the password by storing a new password in Flash memory.
